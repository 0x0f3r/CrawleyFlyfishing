 <div> I need a bunch more posts to test the new page building script.</div><div class='pull-right'> Sat 19th Oct 2013 22:23 </div><hr><h3>A whole bunch of changes</h3> 
 <div> There has been a lot of changes to the site since I last made a post. I have changed the styling almost completely doing away with the tacky shadows and rounded corners. I have also removed the news posting and logging in from the site. I now have a separate admin site which uses directory based ht access to stop any Joe posting news letters. This is a secure way of doing it which removed the need for a sql server and is one less thing that could break. I have also added a gallery and a calendar. The calendar uses google as they can do a much better job than I could ever do. People can also add Google calendar to their phones. 

There are still a whole load of things that need to be done before the site is finished. I need a way for admins to upload images to the site and easily get their file path so they can easily add images to the news posts. The admin site also needs a way to view, delete and modify news posts. This shouldn't be too hard but has to be done. I also need to figure out a nice way of aligning images in the slider on the front page and the image viewer in the gallery. After I have done all that, I then need to flesh out all the web pages with content and I should be done. Hopefully I can get some help with that from the member of the club as I don't feel qualified to talk about that stuff. 

I have lots of work to do so I shall get back to work.</div><div class='pull-right'> Wed 16th Oct 2013 17:47 </div><hr><h3>Slide real and Internet Explorer</h3> 
 <div> I have been working on a slide real for the home page today. This will display a set of pictures and people will be able to scroll through them. I have also come to the realisation that internet explorer does not support the image API necessary for the client side image preview.&nbsp;I still have a lot more compatability work ahead of me but by the end of it I&nbsp;want to have support for IE7, chrome and firefox.&nbsp;<div><br><div>I also showed the website to some of the guys at the fly fishing club. Alan was glad to hear that he will no longer need to use dreamweaver to update the site. I hope to make a simple and powerful application to make updating the site as painless as possible. This will hopefully encourage users to post stories on here.&nbsp;</div></div></div><div class='pull-right'> Wed 11th Sep 2013 21:31 </div><hr>
