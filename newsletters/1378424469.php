<h3>
	All old news posts are gone!</h3> 
 <div> <p>That's right. Sadly I have deleted all previous news posts but not all is lost because it's for a good reason. I have finally implemented the posting mechanism. It's still very feature lacking but if you have an account with the correct privilege level then you should be able to post news to the newsletter by clicking the new post link at the top of this page.&nbsp;</p><p>Previously, news posts were just statically coded into the page but now they are dynamically loaded from a folder through some PHP magic. This means that you no longer have to know HTML to post on this site.&nbsp;</p><p>In the future, I plan on adding more functionality to the editor. Right now all you can do is enter the text and submit it. There is a live preview below what you are typing so you can see what it will look like when it is posted. There is also am "Add Image" button however this is not functional at this time. That's the next thing on my to do list. I plan to have other buttons there to allow things like bullet points and URLs. Each button will produce a snippet of code that when pasted in here, will be processed and turned into the desired HTML. This code should be simple like "&lt;image source=/path/to/img.png&gt;" but even of you don't know how it works you can still blindly cut and past.&nbsp;</p></div><div class='pull-right'> Fri 6th Sep 2013 0:41 </div>
