<h3>Image uploads!</h3> 
 <div> You can now (temporarily) upload images on the new post screen by clicking the add image button, selecting an image and then clicking the test upload button. This is not how images are going to be managed. All images will be kept local and then the ones you use will be automatically detected and uploaded when you submit the post. This is just how I tested how image uploads work.&nbsp;<div>Next up is to figure out how to add images to a post. I am planning on a format like [img src="local:1"] for images that are to be uploaded and [img src="https//:www.website.com/image.png"] for external images. I'm not sure what the legal implications of linking to external websites for images is so I may only allow uploaded files to be used. If that is the case the the syntax will likely be [img 1] for the first image you add and then [img 2] for the second. We shall see. &nbsp;<br></div></div><div class='pull-right'> Sat 7th Sep 2013 12:45 </div>
