<h3>Slide real and Internet Explorer</h3> 
 <div> I have been working on a slide real for the home page today. This will display a set of pictures and people will be able to scroll through them. I have also come to the realisation that internet explorer does not support the image API necessary for the client side image preview.&nbsp;I still have a lot more compatability work ahead of me but by the end of it I&nbsp;want to have support for IE7, chrome and firefox.&nbsp;<div><br><div>I also showed the website to some of the guys at the fly fishing club. Alan was glad to hear that he will no longer need to use dreamweaver to update the site. I hope to make a simple and powerful application to make updating the site as painless as possible. This will hopefully encourage users to post stories on here.&nbsp;</div></div></div><div class='pull-right'> Wed 11th Sep 2013 21:31 </div>
