<h3>A whole bunch of changes</h3> 
 <div> There has been a lot of changes to the site since I last made a post. I have changed the styling almost completely doing away with the tacky shadows and rounded corners. I have also removed the news posting and logging in from the site. I now have a separate admin site which uses directory based ht access to stop any Joe posting news letters. This is a secure way of doing it which removed the need for a sql server and is one less thing that could break. I have also added a gallery and a calendar. The calendar uses google as they can do a much better job than I could ever do. People can also add Google calendar to their phones. 

There are still a whole load of things that need to be done before the site is finished. I need a way for admins to upload images to the site and easily get their file path so they can easily add images to the news posts. The admin site also needs a way to view, delete and modify news posts. This shouldn't be too hard but has to be done. I also need to figure out a nice way of aligning images in the slider on the front page and the image viewer in the gallery. After I have done all that, I then need to flesh out all the web pages with content and I should be done. Hopefully I can get some help with that from the member of the club as I don't feel qualified to talk about that stuff. 

I have lots of work to do so I shall get back to work.</div><div class='pull-right'> Wed 16th Oct 2013 17:47 </div>
