<h3 class='title'>All old posts are gone, again!</h3><div class='content'><p style="" class=""><p>I have deleted all old posts because I made a mistake in how the old php script saved posts to disk. The content div and the date div both had ids rather than classes. This meant that when they were all added to the same web page by either newsletter.php or admin/view-posts.php there would be multiple divs with the same ids. I changed this and now all new posts should be correct.</p><p>I also added some functionality to view-posts<span id="sceditor-end-marker" class="sceditor-selection sceditor-ignore" style="line-height: 0; display: none;"> </span><span id="sceditor-start-marker" class="sceditor-selection sceditor-ignore" style="line-height: 0; display: none;"> </span>.php. If you click of the title of the posts then the content will display. I plan to add some more buttons to it that allow you to edit the posts in here and also delete or hide them. Once that is done, the core functionality of the web site should be complete and it may go live.</p><br></p><p style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; background-color: rgb(245, 245, 245);"></p></div><div class='pull-right' class='date'>Mon 6th Jan 2014 23:16</div>
