<h3 class='title'>Down for maintanence? </h3><div class='content'><p>I learnt that today that Simon can be really mean. He rebooted my server which causes my uptime to reset. This may not sound like a big deal to non computer scientists but it is effectively the same as somebody dropping your pants in the middle on the lunch hall.

In other news, rebooting works.&nbsp;<span id="sceditor-end-marker" class="sceditor-selection sceditor-ignore" style="line-height: 0; display: none;"> </span><span id="sceditor-start-marker" class="sceditor-selection sceditor-ignore" style="line-height: 0; display: none;"> </span></p></div><div class='pull-right' class='date'>Mon 6th Jan 2014 23:25</div>
