<h3 class='title'>Lots and Lots of progress</h3><div class='content'><div class="content"><p>I have made quite a lot of progress on the site. The view posts page is basically complete. It's paginated and each post now has edit and delete buttons. Clicking on the title will show the whole post. Clicking the delete and edit buttons now do what they are meant to do. Functionally it is complete but there are a few small things that need doing. I will implement that soon. Once that is done, I think I will work on simplifying and documenting the code in this site so that it may be maintained by another.&nbsp;</p><p>You may have noticed that there are a lot of pony related posts. I made the mistake of asking my house mates to help out with populating the news letter. "Bowtie" took that as an invitation to post a load of pony related things. The sad thing is that is quite nicely demonstrates how well the editor works. I think I will leave them there until the newsletter is a bit more fleshed out.&nbsp;<span id="sceditor-end-marker" class="sceditor-selection sceditor-ignore" style="line-height: 0; display: none;"> </span><span id="sceditor-start-marker" class="sceditor-selection sceditor-ignore" style="line-height: 0; display: none;"> </span></p></div></div><div class='pull-right' class='date'>Sat 11th Jan 2014 6:40</div>
